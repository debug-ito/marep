# [Abandoned] marep

MaRep was meant to be a simple match-and-replace utility for lists, strings and texts with light-weight dependency, but **is now abandoned.**

If you are looking for match-and-replace tools, probably you should instead try the following packages.

- [regex-applicative: Regex-based parsing with applicative interface](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-applicative)
- [replace-attoparsec: Find, replace, and edit text patterns with Attoparsec parsers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/replace-attoparsec)
- [replace-megaparsec: Find, replace, and edit text patterns with Megaparsec parsers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/replace-megaparsec)
